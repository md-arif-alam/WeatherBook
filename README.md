## Getting Started

### 1. Introduction:

"WeatherBook" is a full-stack weather application designed to provide users with accurate and up-to-date weather information. The application leverages modern technologies such as Next.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and the OpenWeatherMap API to deliver a seamless user experience.



 2. Technologies Used:
   
    **[_Next.js_]**:
Next.js is a React framework that offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing out of the box. It simplifies the development process and enhances performance by pre-rendering pages.

    **[_React.js_]**:
React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It enables the creation of reusable UI components and facilitates state management, resulting in a more maintainable and scalable codebase.

    **[_Tailwind CSS_]**:
Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-designed utility classes for styling. It allows for rapid development and easy customization, promoting a consistent and responsive design.

    **[_OpenWeatherMap API_]**:
The OpenWeatherMap API is a service that provides weather data, including current weather, forecasts, and historical weather information. It offers a wide range of weather parameters and supports various geographical locations worldwide.



### 3. Setup and Installation:

#### To set up WeatherBook locally, follow these steps:(more details given below)


  -> Clone the repository from GitHub.
  -> Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies using npm or yarn.
  -> Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap and configure it in the application.
  -> Run the development server using the npm/yarn script provided.
  -> Access the application in your web browser at the specified localhost address.


###  4. Project Structure:

#### WeatherBook follows a structured folder organization:

 -> Pages: Contains Next.js page components for routing.
 -> Components: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.

 -> Searching for weather data by city name using the search bar.
 -> Providing detailed weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,UV-radiation,week's forecast etc.
 -> Responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experience across devices.


### 6. Future Enhancements:

#### In future releases, WeatherBook could include the following enhancements:

 -> User authentication and account creation for saving favorite locations.
 -> Forecast data display to show weather predictions for multiple days.
 -> Geolocation functionality for automatic detection of the user's location.
 -> Notification system to alert users of severe weather conditions or personalized preferences.
 -> Social sharing options to allow users to share weather updates on social media platforms.


 ### 7. Deployment:

#### Deploying WeatherBook to a hosting platform is straightforward:

  -> Choose a hosting provider such as Vercel, Netlify, or Heroku.
  -> Configure deployment settings and environment variables.
  -> Push the codebase to the chosen hosting platform's repository.
  -> Follow the platform-specific deployment instructions to deploy the application.


### 8. Conclusion:

"WeatherBook" is a powerful weather application built with cutting-edge technologies, offering users a seamless weather tracking experience. With its modern stack and potential for future enhancements, "WeatherBook" is poised to become a go-to solution for accessing weather information reliably and efficiently.

This comprehensive documentation provides insights into WeatherBook's architecture, features, setup process, and potential for further development.


## How to locally run the app

First, run the development server:

npm run dev
### or
yarn dev
### or
pnpm dev
### or
bun dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
